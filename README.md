# Tiny Store: Lightweight Svelte 5 Storefront

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

Project uses Appwrite as the backend. And this will only work if you set up everything correctly. More on that on the future (maybe).

This SvelteKit project uses `adapter-auto`.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
